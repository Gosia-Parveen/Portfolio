        <h1>Participated in IICBS 2025 conference.</h1>
        <p>I presented my research at the IICBS 2025 conference, delivering a detailed presentation and confidently defending it by answering
          several questions. The title of my research article was "License Plate Recognition using YOLOv8". This experience improved my 
          ability to communicate complex ideas and strengthened my public speaking skills.</p>
        <p>This model uses videos from the traffic cams or other cameras as input, then YOLOv8 is used to detect the location of license
          plates in video frames or images, efficiently isolating the plate region. Once detected, the system uses optical character 
          recognition (OCR) algorithms to extract and read the alphanumeric characters on the plate. Then a video is generated as an 
          output by the model, this output video is same as the input video but in this video all the license plates are displayed clearly 
          above the moving vehicle. With the help of this project the authorities and police departments can track the culprit’s car, trace
          the actual owner of a vehicle and can do other various operations much more easily and accurately in comparatively less time.</p>

        <h1>Published an article in STM journals in 2024.</h1>
        <p>The title of my research article was "Prediction of Mobile Phone Price using Machine learning classifiers" and it was published in
          STM journals. This was my first time writing a research article, and it helped me gain exposure to academic publishing and 
          understand all the norms of this field.</p>
        <p>In this study, we propose a approach for predicting mobile phone prices by using machine learning, although there are several 
          machine learning algorithms including linear regression, decision trees, Naive Bayes, and many more, our methodology involves SVM,
          Decision Tree, Random Forest and KNN to train the model and test its accuracy,F1 score, precision and recall. Through rigorous
          experimentation we decipher the most effective algorithms and feature sets to predict the price of mobile phone accurately.
          Such a model can provide valuable insights and assistance to the consumers while buying new mobile phones.</p>

        <h1>3D HOLOGRAM</h1>
        <p>I worked with a team of five to build a 3D hologram project. We showcased it at the Design of Artifacts science fair. 
          The project highlighted how holographic visuals can enhance interactive displays and captivated the audience.</p>
        <p>A 3D hologram is a three-dimensional image created using light that appears to float in space and can be seen from different
          angles, just like a real object. Unlike regular photos or videos (which are flat and 2D), holograms capture the depth, shape, 
          and perspective of an object.</p>
